# Feedback and downstream invalidation

Use this file whenever the user provides dictation, comments, corrections, or new repository evidence after artifacts exist.

## Parse feedback semantically

Preserve qualifiers such as:

- definitely;
- for now;
- eventually;
- I am leaning toward;
- maybe;
- that was only an example;
- I do not care how;
- not that;
- use your recommendation;
- keep researching.

Update the underlying claim strength and time horizon rather than copying the sentence into a notes section.

## Invalidation rules

### Intent change

Examples:

- target user changes;
- required outcome changes;
- a mechanism becomes mandatory or is rejected;
- first-release horizon changes;
- a policy decision reverses.

Action:

- update intent brief and JSON;
- mark brainstorm, shape, and plan stale when affected;
- regenerate only the affected artifacts permitted by the current mode.

### Shape change

Examples:

- source of truth changes;
- selected concept changes;
- external dependency is added or removed;
- appetite changes materially;
- first proof changes.

Action:

- preserve intent;
- update shape brief;
- mark implementation plan stale;
- re-run implementation-success and dependency analysis.

### Repository discovery

Examples:

- an existing reusable adapter is found;
- the assumed test harness does not exist;
- deployment restrictions invalidate the proposed seam;
- another worktree already contains part of the change.

Action:

- update current reality and plan strategy;
- change the intent only when the user explicitly treats repository constraints as product requirements.

## User-facing delta

After feedback, respond with a short summary:

```markdown
## Updated
- Promoted ... from possibility to first-release requirement.
- Replaced ... with ... in the shape.
- Marked the implementation plan stale because ...

## Next
- Regenerate the plan with the new dependency boundary.
```

Do not repost the complete brief in chat.
